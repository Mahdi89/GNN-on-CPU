Here we include a set of small codes that give an example of how to
program a Vector Indexed Architecture (referred as VAQUERO). Both
programs provide a different view of how to use the scratchpad for
its both execution types: direct and associative.

Check the files in the next order:

1. vaquero_hist_examples.cc: It is a simple histogram implementation that uses both execution modes.
2. vaquero_aggregation_example.cc: Data aggregation example using the associative execution mode of the scratchpad.
